# NLP:

## Fastai2 with transformers:
https://github.com/aikindergarten/fasthugs

https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr

**Tip:** seems like unfreezing and fine-tuning entire model can have equal or better performance than freezing and gradually unfreezing model

**General models to use**
- classification: (distil)roberta, bart, deberta ([deberta-v3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-small))

## **Label Smoothing**:

loss_func=FlattenedLoss(LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy, axis=-1) for NLP

## SAM for NLP
https://github.com/davda54/sam

[seems to work well for NLP as well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08529)


## Fixing mismatch between vocab size in data_clas and data_lm:

```
data_clas.vocab.itos = data_lm.vocab.itos

```
Before the following line
```
learn_c = text_classifier_learner(data_clas, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3)
```
This has fixed the error.

## **Concatenating models to use metadata:**

and notebook https://www.kaggle.com/adai183/metadata-enhanced-text-classification

## **Can try using QRNN***

https://github.com/piegu/language-models/blob/master/lm2-french.ipynb 


## **AWD-LSTM Specific**

- Higher drop_mult on LM learner (1.), then smaller dropout on classifier

- Ensemble a fwd and backwards bwd = True models
  - backwards model: https://github.com/fastai/course-nlp/blob/master/nn-vietnamese-bwd.ipynb 
  - ensemble model: https://github.com/fastai/course-nlp 
  
## Data augmentation for NLP
- backtranslation - translate text into another language, then translate back: https://amitness.com/2020/02/back-translation-in-google-sheets/
- other methods: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07499
- data augmentation library https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy

### additional data augmentation techniques (from kaggle winning solution)

- random cropping
- progressive resizing
  - eg start with `max_length` in tokenizer of `128`, then `256`, etc.
- cutout: replace 0-10% of tokens with `[MASK]`

## Training model on synthetic data
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09193.pdf
- use a large language model (T5, GPT3, GPTJ, etc.)
- use prompt to generate sample text **conditioned** on a label, eg
  ```
  Sample Movie Review: This is the most saccharine romance I ever
  sat through. The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief,
  housedress, and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the
  afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbons. In fact, bonbons play a
  prominent role in the movie. The only reason I was able to watch to
  the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reevesâ€™ dreamy
  face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast
  to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo
  Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than
  Mexican, really.
  
  Negative Movie Review:
  ```
- train discriminative model (BERT, T5, BART, etc.) using label and synthetic text
- (Optional?) fine-tune on actual dataset

## Topic Modelling
- unsupervised topic mining
- Methods:
  - LDA
  - NMF
  - SBERT + Clustering
  - GPT 
- https://hackmd.io/uVFpqWb9Q0KV3fmq0LdvMA

### Distilling sentences to make it easier to model topics
- intuition: shorter sentences lead -> easier to cluster -> better topic model topics
- zero-shot: using GPT/LLM model for zero-shot summarization using prompt engineering
- supervised: use a model like BART to distill text into shorter text

### Contextualized Topic Models (CTM)
- SOTA Survey: https://silviatti.github.io/resources/alliancebernstein_30_10_20.pdf
- [Cross-lingual Contextualized Topic Models with Zero-shot Learning](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/cross-lingual-contextualized-topic-models)
  - contexualized topic models (CTM) github repo: https://github.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models
  - Example tutorial with CTM: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fXJjr_rwqvpp1IdNQ4dxqN4Dp88cxO97?usp=sharing#scrollTo=iZEPr_QFJdBz

**Notes**:
- the encoder generates a `mu` and `sigma`, which are of size `(bs, n_components)` aka `n_topics`
- to get a predicted topic, the decoder network samples `n` times from a gaussian distribution with `mu, sigma` to get `theta`, then take the argmax of the avg probabilities 
  ```
  def get_theta(self, x, x_bert, labels=None):
        with torch.no_grad():
            # batch_size x n_components
            posterior_mu, posterior_log_sigma = self.inf_net(x, x_bert, labels)
            #posterior_sigma = torch.exp(posterior_log_sigma)

            # generate samples from theta
            theta = F.softmax(
                self.reparameterize(posterior_mu, posterior_log_sigma), dim=1)

            return theta
  ```

  - here `|K| == n_components`
  - take argmax of sampled representation to get topic

- Possible extension: use GPT (or some summarization model) as a summarizer (reduce the length of text to make it easier to learn), then use CTM 
  - CTM is used for ~200 tokens, so maybe not as useful for super short documents
  - maybe inject GPT topic as another context vector (either another vector to concatenate, or add GPT topic to original text)
  - instead of reconstructing original sentence, construct a distilled sentence (eg summarized by GPT/BART etc.)

### Training State-of-the-art Text Embedding Models
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHY-3FzaLGc

![training process](https://github.com/maxmatical/ml-cheatsheet/blob/master/images/neural_search.png)

Sample code: https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/ms_marco/README.html#ms-marco

used for 
- search
- Information retreival
- Question Answering

Uses a similarity matrix for loss (similar to CLIP)

### Information Retreival Pipeline
- bi-encoder (for large collections of docs): https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/ms_marco/README.html#bi-encoder 
  - train using `MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`, `MarginMSE`, or the method described above for SOTA text embedding model
- cross encoder (for smaller collections OR after candidate retreival from bi-encoder): https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/ms_marco/README.html#cross-encoder
- One way to combine both encoders: https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html
- **combine cross-encoder and bi-encoder with `MarginMSE`**
    - train cross encoder (CE) first (either from scratch or knowledge distillation)
    - for each `(query, doc1, doc2)` triplet, calculate
        - `CE_distance = CEScore(query, doc1) - CEScore(query, doc2)`, (cache `CEScore` as `{query, doc, score}`)
            - alternatively: use `CE` in the training. don't add `CE` params to optimizer, freeze parameters, and make sure gradients aren't tracked when calling `CE` (either `no_grad` or `inference_mode`) to compute `CEScore`
        - `BE_distance = BEScore(query, doc1) - BEScore(query, doc2)` (by default `BEScore` is dot-product, but can also be cosine-similarity)

### Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL) 
GPL is an unsupervised domain adaptation method for training dense retrievers. It is based on query generation and pseudo labeling with powerful cross-encoders. To train a domain-adapted model, it needs only the unlabeled target corpus and can achieve significant improvement over zero-shot models.
