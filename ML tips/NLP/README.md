based off of [Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments 2nd place solution](https://wandb.ai/darek/fbck/reports/How-To-Build-an-Efficient-NLP-Model--VmlldzoyNTE5MDEx)

### deberta
- most top solutions for nlp converged to deberta for seq classification tasks
- if > 512 tokens, longformer works better than bert/roberta/bart, but deberta can handle >512 tokens
- note for deberta >v2 use new vocab
- encoder-decoder models may work better for seq2seq tasks (translation, QA, summarization)
    - classification -> better to use encoder only
    - T5 would be an interesting model to try as well

### data augmentation for NLP
- random crop: take only a part of text
- cutout: replace tokens with `MASK` token -> very common technique in kaggle comps (also called token dropout, random masking)
- progressive resizing: start with shorter seq len -> grow as you train

### advarsarial weight perturbation (AWP)
- during training, perturb the inputs and weights
- leads to flatter loss landscape -> better generalization 
- requires longer training (2-3x)
- requires tuining `adv_lr`, `adv_eps`, `start_epoch`
- check the AWP notebook on kaggle

### using additional data (pseudolabelling)
- might have acess to a lot of data, but unlabelled
    - this was the case with this kaggle comp
    - had a lot of essays form prev comps that didn't have labels
1. additional mlm in-domain pre-training (domain adaptation)
2. multi-task (multi-stage) finetuning
    - finetune on auxillary task(a similar task) then finetune on target task (sequential)
3. pseudolabels
    - train on labelled data (1 or multiple models)
    - generate pseudolabels for unlabelled data
    - noisier labels, but lots more data
    - soft labels work better than hard labels in practice
        - take all data instead of just high confidence hard labels
        - use KL divergence loss on soft labels! (check logits or confidence?)
            - seems like predicted probability
    - first train on pseudolabeled data ONLY via KL divergence, then finetune on labeled data normally

### additional techniques
1. setting dropout to 0
    - all layers in transformers
    - may vary across arch/tasks
        - may need to experiment (may be case by case basis)
2. SWA
    - average weights across checkpoints
    - took task 3 checkpoints instead of a % of training epochs


## Fastai2 with transformers:
https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr

**Tip:** seems like unfreezing and fine-tuning entire model can have equal or better performance than freezing and gradually unfreezing model

## General models to use
- classification: (distil)roberta, bart, deberta ([deberta-v3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-small)), electra, t5 (conditional generation)

## **Label Smoothing**:

loss_func=FlattenedLoss(LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy, axis=-1) for NLP

## SAM for NLP
https://github.com/davda54/sam

[seems to work well for NLP as well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08529)


## Data augmentation for NLP
- backtranslation - translate text into another language, then translate back: https://amitness.com/2020/02/back-translation-in-google-sheets/
- other methods: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07499
- data augmentation library https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy

### additional data augmentation techniques (from kaggle winning solution)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering/discussion/287923?fbclid=IwAR2unJF_zFq0wGTU8d4h_FqcA9JnVrGieriOgVigQoTrWNXnADGYE-E0I1M

- random cropping
- progressive resizing
  - eg start with `max_length` in tokenizer of `128`, then `256`, etc.
- cutout: replace 0-10% of tokens with `[MASK]`
  - this will need to be done in the collator function

## Training model on synthetic data
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09193.pdf
- use a large language model (T5, GPT3, GPTJ, etc.)
- use prompt to generate sample text **conditioned** on a label, eg
  ```
  Sample Movie Review: This is the most saccharine romance I ever
  sat through. The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief,
  housedress, and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the
  afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbons. In fact, bonbons play a
  prominent role in the movie. The only reason I was able to watch to
  the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reevesâ€™ dreamy
  face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast
  to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo
  Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than
  Mexican, really.
  
  Negative Movie Review:
  ```
- train discriminative model (BERT, T5, BART, etc.) using label and synthetic text
- (Optional) fine-tune on actual dataset, can use dev set performane to decide whether or not to perform this step

### synthetic data in IR
InPars:
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05144
- Use GPT3 to generate questions from a document (simlar to GPL)
- Fine-tune on synethetic + real data

GPL: using finetuned T5 to generate queries from a document


## Topic Modelling
- unsupervised topic mining
- Methods:
  - LDA
  - NMF
  - SBERT + Clustering
  - GPT 
- https://hackmd.io/uVFpqWb9Q0KV3fmq0LdvMA

### Distilling sentences to make it easier to model topics
- intuition: shorter sentences lead -> easier to cluster -> better topic model topics
- zero-shot: using GPT/LLM model for zero-shot summarization using prompt engineering
- supervised: use a model like BART to distill text into shorter text

### Contextualized Topic Models (CTM)
- SOTA Survey: https://silviatti.github.io/resources/alliancebernstein_30_10_20.pdf
- [Cross-lingual Contextualized Topic Models with Zero-shot Learning](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/cross-lingual-contextualized-topic-models)
  - contexualized topic models (CTM) github repo: https://github.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models
  - Example tutorial with CTM: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fXJjr_rwqvpp1IdNQ4dxqN4Dp88cxO97?usp=sharing#scrollTo=iZEPr_QFJdBz

**Notes**:
- the encoder generates a `mu` and `sigma`, which are of size `(bs, n_components)` aka `n_topics`
- to get a predicted topic, the decoder network samples `n` times from a gaussian distribution with `mu, sigma` to get `theta`, then take the argmax of the avg probabilities 
  ```
  def get_theta(self, x, x_bert, labels=None):
        with torch.no_grad():
            # batch_size x n_components
            posterior_mu, posterior_log_sigma = self.inf_net(x, x_bert, labels)
            #posterior_sigma = torch.exp(posterior_log_sigma)

            # generate samples from theta
            theta = F.softmax(
                self.reparameterize(posterior_mu, posterior_log_sigma), dim=1)

            return theta
  ```
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8890262/136230216-35286ecf-2788-486a-b2a9-88fcc127a3bf.png)
  - here `|K| == n_components`
  - take argmax of sampled representation to get topic

- Possible extension: use GPT (or some summarization model) as a summarizer (reduce the length of text to make it easier to learn), then use CTM 
  - CTM is used for ~200 tokens, so maybe not as useful for super short documents
  - maybe inject GPT topic as another context vector (either another vector to concatenate, or add GPT topic to original text)
  - instead of reconstructing original sentence, construct a distilled sentence (eg summarized by GPT/BART etc.)


- idea: 
  - embeddings seems to work better on shorter sentences? (from observation)
  - use gpt to "summarize"
  - use trained/pretrained autoencoder to generate embeddings
  - cluster/knn from that?

### using BERTopic for topic modelling
https://www.pinecone.io/learn/bertopic/?utm_content=207629974&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-20299330

- transformer embedding model
- UMAP dimensionality reduction
- HDBSCAN clustering
- Cluster tagging using c-TF-IDF

use custom tranformer model with
```
topic_model = BERTopic(embedding_model={$hf-model-checkpoint})
```

### BertTopic + GPU with cuML
https://medium.com/bumble-tech/multilingual-gpu-powered-topic-modelling-at-scale-dc8bd08609ef?fbclid=IwAR05S4dwVZcAvpJ3e7jks2yaUTJ_6LA2ONS67iayBU_OX6VV2GF5j0FbW_8

## Mixup for text
twitter thread: https://twitter.com/TheZachMueller/status/1451187672072921101

paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02394
- use mixup implementation https://github.com/facebookresearch/mixup-cifar10/blob/main/train.py#L152
    - use mixup in the `forward`, and `return (out, targets_a, targets_b) if self.train else out`


## improving NLP models without scaling

  - useful for topic modelling/distilling longer sentences into shorter ones (see topic modelling)


## domain adaptation of text embedding models

https://www.sbert.net/examples/domain_adaptation/README.html
- eg adapt a SBERT model to your text corpus
- data can come in different formats see: https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/embedding-training-data
  - can have a similar set up to DPR with `query, pos` pairs


## replace attention layers with ALIBI in decoder only LMs
https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/v0.5.0/method_cards/alibi.html

## Mosaic ML: Composer - ALiBi for BERT/RoBERTa
https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/method_cards/alibi.html#alibi
- requires composer >= 0.9
- Supports BERT/RoBERTa and similar archs
  - will log an error if model class is unsupported (double check)

## Self training for NLP (few-shot classification)

## What Language Model Architecture and Pretraining Objective Work Best for Zero-Shot Generalization?
https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05832

- best zero-shot performance, decoder only transformer trained on causal language modelling (think GPT-x)
- encoder-decoder model w/ mlm pretraining + multitask finetuning performed the best
- Compromise: decoder only model + causal lm + additional mlm (non causal lm)
- Question: does this generalize to IR? doesn't seem to be an evaluated task so not too sure
  - seems from recent papers (SGPT-BE, GTR) encoder only still performs better in fine-tuning, but SGPT generalizes better in BEIR

## Weak supervision for NLP (skweak, snorkle)
- define a set of labelling functions
- aggregate to create labels
- train model on weakly supervised labels
- [skweak](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skweak)
- [snorkle](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel)

## GLM-130B
- blog post: http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/glm-130b/posts/glm-130b/
- arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02414
- github: https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B
  - includes training + architecture recipe
  - Interesting finding: using embedding normalization (used in BLOOM) stabilizes training, but reduces downstream performance significantly
  - https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B/blob/main/logs/main-log-en.md
- leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization, without quantization aware training and with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models
- Improvements over GPT/PALM/OPT/BLOOM etc.
  - ROPE as positional encoding was better than ALIBI
  - mask in-filling + prefix lm objective
  - Deepnorm instead of pre-LN for layer norm improved stability in training
  - GeGLU instead of FFN (GLU + GELU activation)
  - No embedding norm (from BLOOM) since it lowered performance
  - Embedding Layer Gradient Shrink: identifies that the gradient norm can serve as an informative indicator of training collapses

## Improvements to train large language models
https://twitter.com/nlpguy_/status/1556881385927098369
- 2D positional encodings (GLM > GPT3)
  - from GLM experiments ROPE > ALIBI (may be due to infilling objective)
- allowing arbitrary order to predict spans
- Normformer
- P-tuning v2
- MoE (mixture of experts)
- Scaling data is as important as scaling model size (Chinchilla)
- In-filling maybe better than left to right decoding (GLM)
- GeGLU instead of FFN
- DeepNorm instead of pre-LN for layer norm
- don't use embedding norm

## Considerations for code generation models (discussions from BigCode)
1. Architecture choice: AE, DE, Seq2seq
  - DE may work better for zero-shot, seq2seq better for finetuning
2. Training objective
  - AR (left to right) generation vs fill-in-the-middle (FIM)/causal masking
  - FIM seems more promising than causal masking?
3. Positional encoding
  - Rotary embedding vs ALIBI
  - ALIBI + FIM/causal masking may hurt performance since the tokens are rotated
    - may require "rotating" the matrix

Considerations:
1. FIM + rotary 
2. FIM + alibi
  - rotated vs un-rotated alibi
3. rotary + no FIM
