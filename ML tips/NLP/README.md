## Kaggle - how to build an efficient NLP model 
based off of [Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments 2nd place solution](https://wandb.ai/darek/fbck/reports/How-To-Build-an-Efficient-NLP-Model--VmlldzoyNTE5MDEx)

### deberta
- most top solutions for nlp converged to deberta for seq classification tasks
- if > 512 tokens, longformer works better than bert/roberta/bart, but deberta can handle >512 tokens
- note for deberta >v2 use new vocab
- encoder-decoder models may work better for seq2seq tasks (translation, QA, summarization)
    - classification -> better to use encoder only
    - T5 would be an interesting model to try as well

### data augmentation for NLP
- random crop: take only a part of text
- cutout: replace tokens with `MASK` token -> very common technique in kaggle comps (also called token dropout, random masking)
- progressive resizing: start with shorter seq len -> grow as you train

### advarsarial weight perturbation (AWP)
- during training, perturb the inputs and weights
- leads to flatter loss landscape -> better generalization 
- requires longer training (2-3x)
- requires tuining `adv_lr`, `adv_eps`, `start_epoch`
- check the AWP notebook on kaggle

### using additional data (pseudolabelling)
- might have acess to a lot of data, but unlabelled
    - this was the case with this kaggle comp
    - had a lot of essays form prev comps that didn't have labels
1. additional mlm in-domain pre-training (domain adaptation)
2. multi-task (multi-stage) finetuning
    - finetune on auxillary task(a similar task) then finetune on target task (sequential)
3. pseudolabels
    - train on labelled data (1 or multiple models)
    - generate pseudolabels for unlabelled data
    - noisier labels, but lots more data
    - soft labels work better than hard labels in practice
        - take all data instead of just high confidence hard labels
        - use KL divergence loss on soft labels! (check logits or confidence?)
            - seems like predicted probability
    - first train on pseudolabeled data ONLY via KL divergence, then finetune on labeled data normally
    - another usecase (not in this article could be self-consistency filtering)
      - 1. train on all pseudolabeled data w/ hard labels
      - 2. predict on itself, keep only data where `pred == label`
      - 3. finetune on (can try different configs)
        - filtered pseudolabel data + labeled data, OR
        - filtered pseudolabel data -> labeled data OR
        - filtered pseudolabel data + labeled data -> labeled data (3 step finetuning)

### More pseudolabeling tips from same competition (1st place winner)
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-effectiveness/discussion/347536?ref=mlcontests

Pseudo labels
Another major part of our solution is pseudo labeling. We applied 3 stages of pseudo labeling on the extra data from the previous Feedback competition. It was done in a leak-free manner for the individual folds and additionally for our models trained on all the data (6 versions of pseudo labels in total). The process consisted of the following steps:

1. Train an ensemble of models only on the given train data
2. Run predictions on the previous Feedback competition data using our full 2-stage pipeline
3. Use soft pseudo labels from this extra dataset and apply it to modeling in two different ways:
  - Concatenate pseudo labels with the actual labels in the given train data, and train simultaneously on all this data
  - Pre-train models on the pseudo labels and finetune it only on the given train data afterwards. Similar to: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04445
4. Repeat steps 1-3 three times using an ensemble of models trained on pseudo labels now

Apart from using previous Feedback competition data for pseudo labels, it was also used in some models as a pre-training dataset. The model was warmed up on the old data predicting the type of the chunk and further finetuned on the given train data.

### additional techniques
1. setting dropout to 0
    - all layers in transformers
    - may vary across arch/tasks
        - may need to experiment (may be case by case basis)
2. SWA
    - average weights across checkpoints
    - took task 3 checkpoints instead of a % of training epochs
    
### [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2023-01-17-nlp-with-disaster-tweets/)
- smaller batch sizes helps model train more quickly
- **train on ALL data (train + dev) after hyperparam tuning/optimization**


## Better pretrained models
https://ibm.github.io/model-recycling/

example: instead of using `roberta-base`, use `janeel/muppet-roberta-base-finetuned-squad` instead

## Fastai2 with transformers:
https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr

**Tip:** seems like unfreezing and fine-tuning entire model can have equal or better performance than freezing and gradually unfreezing model

## General models to use
- classification: (distil)roberta, bart, deberta ([deberta-v3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-small)), electra, t5 (conditional generation)

## **Label Smoothing**:

loss_func=FlattenedLoss(LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy, axis=-1) for NLP

## SAM for NLP
https://github.com/davda54/sam

[seems to work well for NLP as well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08529)


## Data augmentation for NLP
- backtranslation - translate text into another language, then translate back: https://amitness.com/2020/02/back-translation-in-google-sheets/
- other methods: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07499
- data augmentation library https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy

### additional data augmentation techniques (from kaggle winning solution)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering/discussion/287923?fbclid=IwAR2unJF_zFq0wGTU8d4h_FqcA9JnVrGieriOgVigQoTrWNXnADGYE-E0I1M

- random cropping
- progressive resizing
  - eg start with `max_length` in tokenizer of `128`, then `256`, etc.
- cutout: replace 0-10% of tokens with `[MASK]`
  - this will need to be done in the collator function

## Training model on synthetic data
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09193.pdf
- use a large language model (T5, GPT3, GPTJ, etc.)
- use prompt to generate sample text **conditioned** on a label, eg
  ```
  Sample Movie Review: This is the most saccharine romance I ever
  sat through. The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief,
  housedress, and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the
  afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbons. In fact, bonbons play a
  prominent role in the movie. The only reason I was able to watch to
  the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reevesâ€™ dreamy
  face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast
  to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo
  Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than
  Mexican, really.
  
  Negative Movie Review:
  ```
- train discriminative model (BERT, T5, BART, etc.) using label and synthetic text
- (Optional) fine-tune on actual dataset, can use dev set performane to decide whether or not to perform this step

### synthetic data in IR
InPars:
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05144
- Use GPT3 to generate questions from a document (simlar to GPL)
- Fine-tune on synethetic + real data

GPL: using finetuned T5 to generate queries from a document


## Topic Modelling
- unsupervised topic mining
- Methods:
  - LDA
  - NMF
  - SBERT + Clustering
  - GPT 
- https://hackmd.io/uVFpqWb9Q0KV3fmq0LdvMA

### Distilling sentences to make it easier to model topics
- intuition: shorter sentences lead -> easier to cluster -> better topic model topics
- zero-shot: using GPT/LLM model for zero-shot summarization using prompt engineering
- supervised: use a model like BART to distill text into shorter text

### Contextualized Topic Models (CTM)
- SOTA Survey: https://silviatti.github.io/resources/alliancebernstein_30_10_20.pdf
- [Cross-lingual Contextualized Topic Models with Zero-shot Learning](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/cross-lingual-contextualized-topic-models)
  - contexualized topic models (CTM) github repo: https://github.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models
  - Example tutorial with CTM: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fXJjr_rwqvpp1IdNQ4dxqN4Dp88cxO97?usp=sharing#scrollTo=iZEPr_QFJdBz

**Notes**:
- the encoder generates a `mu` and `sigma`, which are of size `(bs, n_components)` aka `n_topics`
- to get a predicted topic, the decoder network samples `n` times from a gaussian distribution with `mu, sigma` to get `theta`, then take the argmax of the avg probabilities 
  ```
  def get_theta(self, x, x_bert, labels=None):
        with torch.no_grad():
            # batch_size x n_components
            posterior_mu, posterior_log_sigma = self.inf_net(x, x_bert, labels)
            #posterior_sigma = torch.exp(posterior_log_sigma)

            # generate samples from theta
            theta = F.softmax(
                self.reparameterize(posterior_mu, posterior_log_sigma), dim=1)

            return theta
  ```
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8890262/136230216-35286ecf-2788-486a-b2a9-88fcc127a3bf.png)
  - here `|K| == n_components`
  - take argmax of sampled representation to get topic

- Possible extension: use GPT (or some summarization model) as a summarizer (reduce the length of text to make it easier to learn), then use CTM 
  - CTM is used for ~200 tokens, so maybe not as useful for super short documents
  - maybe inject GPT topic as another context vector (either another vector to concatenate, or add GPT topic to original text)
  - instead of reconstructing original sentence, construct a distilled sentence (eg summarized by GPT/BART etc.)


- idea: 
  - embeddings seems to work better on shorter sentences? (from observation)
  - use gpt to "summarize"
  - use trained/pretrained autoencoder to generate embeddings
  - cluster/knn from that?

### using BERTopic for topic modelling
https://www.pinecone.io/learn/bertopic/?utm_content=207629974&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-20299330

- transformer embedding model
- UMAP dimensionality reduction
- HDBSCAN clustering
- Cluster tagging using c-TF-IDF

use custom tranformer model with
```
topic_model = BERTopic(embedding_model={$hf-model-checkpoint})
```

### BertTopic + GPU with cuML
https://medium.com/bumble-tech/multilingual-gpu-powered-topic-modelling-at-scale-dc8bd08609ef?fbclid=IwAR05S4dwVZcAvpJ3e7jks2yaUTJ_6LA2ONS67iayBU_OX6VV2GF5j0FbW_8

## Mixup for text
twitter thread: https://twitter.com/TheZachMueller/status/1451187672072921101

paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02394
- use mixup implementation https://github.com/facebookresearch/mixup-cifar10/blob/main/train.py#L152
    - use mixup in the `forward`, and `return (out, targets_a, targets_b) if self.train else out`

  - useful for topic modelling/distilling longer sentences into shorter ones (see topic modelling)


## domain adaptation of text embedding models

https://www.sbert.net/examples/domain_adaptation/README.html
- eg adapt a SBERT model to your text corpus
- data can come in different formats see: https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/embedding-training-data
  - can have a similar set up to DPR with `query, pos` pairs


## replace attention layers with ALIBI in decoder only LMs
https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/v0.5.0/method_cards/alibi.html

## Mosaic ML: Composer - ALiBi for BERT/RoBERTa
https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/method_cards/alibi.html#alibi
- requires composer >= 0.9
- Supports BERT/RoBERTa and similar archs
  - will log an error if model class is unsupported (double check)

## Self training for NLP (few-shot classification)

## What Language Model Architecture and Pretraining Objective Work Best for Zero-Shot Generalization?
https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05832

- best zero-shot performance, decoder only transformer trained on causal language modelling (think GPT-x)
- encoder-decoder model w/ mlm pretraining + multitask finetuning performed the best
- Compromise: decoder only model + causal lm + additional mlm (non causal lm)
- Question: does this generalize to IR? doesn't seem to be an evaluated task so not too sure
  - seems from recent papers (SGPT-BE, GTR) encoder only still performs better in fine-tuning, but SGPT generalizes better in BEIR

## Weak supervision for NLP (skweak, snorkle)
- define a set of labelling functions
- aggregate to create labels
- train model on weakly supervised labels
- [skweak](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skweak)
- [snorkle](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel)

## GLM-130B
- blog post: http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/glm-130b/posts/glm-130b/
- arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02414
- github: https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B
  - includes training + architecture recipe
  - Interesting finding: using embedding normalization (used in BLOOM) stabilizes training, but reduces downstream performance significantly
  - https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B/blob/main/logs/main-log-en.md
- leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization, without quantization aware training and with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models
- Improvements over GPT/PALM/OPT/BLOOM etc.
  - ROPE as positional encoding was better than ALIBI
  - mask in-filling + prefix lm objective
  - Deepnorm instead of pre-LN for layer norm improved stability in training
  - GeGLU instead of FFN (GLU + GELU activation)
  - No embedding norm (from BLOOM) since it lowered performance
  - Embedding Layer Gradient Shrink: identifies that the gradient norm can serve as an informative indicator of training collapses

## Improvements to train large language models
https://twitter.com/nlpguy_/status/1556881385927098369
- 2D positional encodings (GLM > GPT3)
  - from GLM experiments ROPE > ALIBI (may be due to infilling objective)
- allowing arbitrary order to predict spans
- Normformer
- P-tuning v2
- MoE (mixture of experts)
- Scaling data is as important as scaling model size (Chinchilla)
- In-filling maybe better than left to right decoding (GLM)
- GeGLU instead of FFN
- DeepNorm instead of pre-LN for layer norm
- don't use embedding norm

## Considerations for code generation models (discussions from BigCode)
1. Architecture choice: AE, DE, Seq2seq
  - DE may work better for zero-shot, seq2seq better for finetuning
2. Training objective
  - AR (left to right) generation vs fill-in-the-middle (FIM)/causal masking
  - FIM seems more promising than causal masking?
3. Positional encoding
  - Rotary embedding vs ALIBI
  - ALIBI + FIM/causal masking may hurt performance since the tokens are rotated
    - may require "rotating" the matrix

Considerations:
1. FIM + rotary 
2. FIM + alibi
  - rotated vs un-rotated alibi
3. rotary + no FIM

## Pretraining bert for $20
https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mosaicbert

## Ultimate stack for PEFT for LLMs (focused on SFT here)
1. transformer model + load in 8bit (4bit in future?)
  - enable gradient checkpointing? or not needed with lora
2. [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) library for `get_peft_model` and `prepare_model_for_int8_training`
  - example: [flan-t5-11b + peft single A10](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-flan-t5-peft)
  - wrap the model and prepare for training
  - other examples provided in repo
3. Lightning or Accelerate as the trainer (lightning preferred)
  - lighting: can use either trainer or `L.Fabric` (which is equivalent to Accelerate), but can use colossal-ai
    - example of using Fabric for pretraining/finetuning llama: https://github.com/lightning-AI/lit-llama#finetune-the-model
    - lightning trainer also provides ability to use SWA callback, but can also just average last k checkpoints or something
    - Accelerate can't use colossalai, but can use deepspeed, may have issues with fsdp + cpu offload: https://github.com/huggingface/peft#peft---accelerate
  - pytorch lightning 2.0 also supports `torch.compile(model)` when `model` is a `LightningModule`
    - https://lightning.ai/pages/blog/training-compiled-pytorch-2.0-with-pytorch-lightning/
4. If lora model still doesn't fit on 1 gpu (need cpu offload), or using multiple gpus with model parallelism, use colossal-ai (better than deepspeed)
  - see chatgpt replication using just colossalai: https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/main/applications/Chat
    - important bits: loramodule
  - also note: compatible with lightning: 
    - see docs: https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/advanced/third_party/colossalai.html
      - few caveats:
        - need `configure_sharded_model` in lightning module (see example in colossalai repo below)
        - needs `colossalai.nn.optimizer.HybridAdam`
        - grad accumulation is only 1 for now
    - example using pytorch lightning: https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI-Pytorch-lightning/tree/main/benchmark/gpt
5. If RLHF on top of that, use [trlx](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx)
  - [suports lora](https://wandb.ai/carperai/trlx/reports/trlx-LORA-support--VmlldzozMjgyMzcy) (but so does trl)
  - [supports 8bit adam](https://wandb.ai/jon-tow/trlx/reports/trlx-Add-bitsandbytes-optimizer-support-133--VmlldzozMjY1MzI1)
  - supports ilql method and nemo-megatron (ilql only for now)
  
## Finetuning LLM tips (#1 kaggle grandmaster) - focus on conversational data
- data: quality > quantity
- Foundation models: llama (non-commercial), `EleutherAI/pythia-12b-deduped` or `EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b` are the best to use for finetuning for conversation right now.
  - recommend pythia over neox: https://twitter.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1649448167782449164
- LORA: use `bf16` for speed
  - for memory, use int8, gradient checkpointing, reduce batch size. should still get decent results
- **loss**: more consistent results only calculating loss on answer (i.e. masking out non-label input ids when calculating ce loss)
- prompt design: a hyperparameter to tune (using tokens, not using tokens, what kind of tokens etc.)

## A Theory on Adam Instability in Large-Scale Machine Learning 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09871

mitigations for instability training llms:
- skipping batches. challenging to implement and require manual monitoring and intervention
- lower learning rate. but makes training longer (need more steps to reach same loss)
- lower `eps` in optimizer. could result in divide by 0 with low precision (fp16 etc.), so 1e-7/1e-8 might be good
- lowering batch size could help, but inefficient
- reduce `beta1` and `beta2` in adam optimizer (see mosaic), downside is could make update stale
- composition of data: higher quality data leads to less instability

## Finetuning llms > prompting llms (should be fairly obvious)
https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1646870571542536195

benefits of finetuning: https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1646365774083244032
  - better model performance, examples become per of models internal knowledge
  - reduce cost of prediction (less tokens used)
  
## Recipe for training large models (LLM related)
twitter thread: https://twitter.com/borisdayma/status/1644358390313877504

report: https://wandb.ai/craiyon/report/reports/Recipe-Training-Large-Models--VmlldzozNjc4MzQz

mainly related to pretraining, not finetuning

key ideas:

General
- start with small model first
- don't stop experiments early, initially promising results could end up worse when fully trained
- experiment fast, keep notes/logs

Stability
- optmizer: shampoo for stability (but not in torch?), adamw with tips from https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09871
- bf16 more stable than standard fp16
- weight decay might not be needed (or kept very low)
- no need for dropout
- normformer (stacking layernorms before and after attn + mlp) may help
- GLU may help
- gradient clipping by global norm to 1.0 or something

batch size and lr
- largest batchsize you can, use gradient accumulation or gradient checkpointing
- lr ports pretty well with model size increase in 5-10x increments
  - lr correlates with effective batch size: if multiply batch size by `k`, also multiply lr by `k`
- do a lr sweep of 3x/10x diff eg 1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3
- optimize lr before expensive training run 
- use a lr warmup typically <=5-10%
- keep lr constant and from time to time increase/decrease lr by 3x increments
  - can use cosine/linear decay if lazy
  - cosine/linear decay to 0 near end of training
  - keep in mind mosaic ml just uses a standard linear decay after warmup so may not be need
  
logging
- Logging of training/validation loss + relevant metrics (accuracyâ€¦).
- Logging of parameters and gradients: 
  - The norm of parameters and gradients should regularly be logged so you can refer to it during instabilities
  - Histograms can be logged optionally (it will impact training speed but is nice to enable when debugging instabilities)
  - At start of training, manually verify that all gradients are flowing properly in your model and that parameters are being updated

## distillation > annoate + finetuning
- twitter thread: https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1653977494196723712
- arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01645
- we find that distilling from T5-XXL (11B) to T5-Small (60M) leads to almost always a cost-efficient option compared to annotating more data to directly train a compact model (T5-Small (60M))
- **main idea**: given a fixed dataset + budget. better to spend the $ to train a large model on the data, and distill into smaller model, rather than spendig $ to annotate more data and finetune smaller model directly on combined data
- distillation done via KL divergence loss on **unlabeled data** (eg pseudolabeling)
  - q: would it perform even better if smaller model was finetuned on the labeled data afterwards? would be interesting to check

## MPT-7b
https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b

- 7b param model better than llama or at least competitive
- because trained on 1T tokens like llama
- Uses GPT-NeoX20B tokenizer (slightly better than standard gpt2 tokenizer)
  - set vocab size from 50,257 -> 50,432 (multiple of 128) and improved MFU by 4 percentage points
- Uses streaming dataset
- Uses ALIBI over positional encoding (improves stability)
- uses Lion optimizer over AdamW
  - more stable update magnitutes AND less optimizer state mem
