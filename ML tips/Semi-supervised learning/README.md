## Semi-supervised learning/self training (for large unlabelled dataset and small labelled dataset)

### using pseudo-labels with fastai (expand training data)
https://isaac-flath.github.io/blog/deep%20learning/2020/12/15/Pseudo-Labeling.html

**Tip**: This same approach can be used on all (or some, based on level of confidence) of the unlabeled data to expand the training data. 

**Multiple ways of using unlabelled data**
1. (only if unlabelled data >> labelled data)
    - train on ALL pseudo-labelled data
    - fine tune on labelled data
    
2. train on labelled data + **ALL** of pseudo-labelled data

3. train on labelled data  + **SOME** of pseudo-labelled data, based on confidence (eg `predicted_proba >= 0.9`)

4. train on labelled data +  **ALL** pseudo-labelled data. Then further fine-tune on labelled data

 Not 100% sure which way is best

### predicting soft pseudo-labels (distributions) to use for distillation/self training etc.
2 ways

1. array datasets with `n x k` matrix of preds as label

2. csv/df datasets with 
```
data | c1 | c2 | ... |cn
x    | y1 | y2 | ... |yn


data = (ImageList
    .from_df(path=tub_path, df=df)
    .split_by_rand_pct()
    .label_from_df(cols=[c1,c2,..., cn],label_cls=FloatList)
    .transform(get_transforms(do_flip=False), size=(120,160))
    .databunch()
    .normalize(imagenet_stats))

```
where `yi` is the predicted probablilty of class `ci`

and use `MSE` as loss function
 - maybe `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` or even `FocalLoss`, with `valid_loss` as monitor will work better
 - will `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` work?
 - `MSE` if output is logits, `BCE/CE` if output is predicted probability (b/w 0 and 1)

### custom accuracy function with soft psuedo-labels
use when psuedo-labels are soft probability distributions or logits
```
def custom_accuracy(pred, target):
    return (pred.argmax(dim=1) == target.argmax(dim=1)).float().mean()
```

### self training with noisy student

https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252 
![noisy student diagram](https://github.com/maxmatical/fast.ai/blob/master/images/noisy-student.jpg)
Note:
- Train student on both labelled and out of sample data -> create new dataset that combines both
- Can either use hard or soft pseudo labelling (soft pseudo labels might be slightly better)
- possible loss for soft speudo labels: https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/catrogircal-cross-entropy-with-soft-classes/50871

### Self-distillation
Similar to self-learning (but same model architecture) (i.e. teacher-student with same model)

https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05715

![self-distillation](https://github.com/maxmatical/fast.ai/blob/master/images/self-distillation.jpg)

**Note**: process is similar to psuedo-labels, just without any additional unlabelled data (predict soft-labels on itself to train)

library for knowledge-distillation (can be used for self-distillation): https://nathanhubens.github.io/fasterai/

- note: will only work if all data is labelled, can't use when there's unlabelled data

### meta pseudo labels
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10580.pdf)
MPL algorithm:
```
for t in range(epochs):
    1. train teacher network on labelled data (1 epoch)
    2. predict on unlabelled data
    3. train student network on unlabelled data (1 epoch)
    4. student predict on a validation set for labelled data to get y_pred_student
    5. use loss(y_val, y_pred_student) (nn.CrossEntropyLoss, etc.) as loss for teacher
    6. gradient update for teacher (gradient through gradient method)
    

```
